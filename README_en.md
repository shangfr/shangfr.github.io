## üìª Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a machine learning algorithm engineer with a strong passion for open-source technologies. Here, you can find a variety of projects I have been involved in, ranging from small tools to large-scale applications, covering multiple domains such as ML, CV, NLP, and more. I am committed to delivering high-quality code and useful tools to help solve practical problems and drive technological advancements.

Here are some of my main projects and contributions on GitHub:

 - [Data-Follower](https://github.com/shangfr/Data-Follower) This is one of my proudest projects, an interactive machine learning application developed using the Streamlit framework. With a guided interface, users can quickly train machine learning models and conveniently make predictions using pre-trained models.

 - [PyDepGraph](https://github.com/shangfr/PyDepGraph) This is a personal project I initiated to address the issue of Python package dependencies in daily development work. I have open-sourced it so that others can benefit from it and contribute as well.

 - [Aesopica](https://github.com/shangfr/Aesopica) This project curates a collection of English versions of Aesop's fables and utilizes AIGC technology to generate the content (moral) and illustrations for each fable. Finally, it applies TTS technology to synthesize animated videos.

 - [ChatSpider](https://github.com/shangfr/ChatSpider) This project uses the LangChain framework to connect various types of text and LLM models. As a result, users can have simple conversations to understand the main content of the text, perform information extraction, data organization, and data analysis.

 - [Shiny-jiebaR](https://github.com/shangfr/Shiny-jiebaR) This is one of my earliest open-source projects. It utilizes the jieba Chinese word segmentation library and the R Shiny framework to create a cloud-based [word segmentation application](https://shangfr.shinyapps.io/Chinese-jiebaR).

## üìö Recommendation

In addition to these projects, the following open-source projects have greatly helped me and have sparked my strong interest:

- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [echarts](https://github.com/apache/echarts)
- **Development and User Interface Design**: [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit), [fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

I believe in the power of open-source and the importance of collaboration. Therefore, I encourage you to explore my projects, ask questions, provide suggestions, and contribute improvements. If you are interested in any of the projects I am currently working on or have any collaboration opportunities, please feel free to contact me.

## üß∞ Example

Simple example of usage of streamlit and FastAPI for ML model serving.

- Create a basic Python Calculator module. 
- Serve the function from the module using FastAPI. 
- Creating a very basic UI using Streamlit. 
- Integrating Streamlit &amp; FastAPI.

To run the example in a machine running Docker and docker-compose, run:

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

To visit the FastAPI documentation of the resulting service, visit http://localhost:8500 with a web browser.  
To visit the streamlit UI, visit http://localhost:8501.

Logs can be inspected via:

    docker-compose logs
